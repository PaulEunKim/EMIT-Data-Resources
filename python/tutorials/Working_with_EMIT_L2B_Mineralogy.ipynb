    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will open the [EMIT L2B Estimated Mineral Identification and Band Depth and Uncertainty (EMITL2BMIN)](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2BMIN.001) products, find a mineral of interest from the ten mineral types focused on by the EMIT mission, evaluate uncertainty, orthorectify the data, then create an output mask or vector file for the granule.\n",

    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMIT instrument is an imaging spectrometer that measures light in visible and infrared wavelengths. These measurements display unique spectral signatures that correspond to the composition on the Earth's surface. The EMIT mission focuses specifically on mapping the composition of minerals to better understand the effects of mineral dust throughout the Earth system and human populations now and in the future. More details about EMIT and its associated products can be found in the **README.md** and on the [EMIT website](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/).\n",

    "The [EMITL2BMIN](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2BMIN.001) data product provides estimated mineral identification, band depths and uncertainty in a spatially raw, non-orthocorrected format. Two spectral groups, which correspond to different regions of the spectra, are identified independently and often co-occur are used to identify minerals. These estimates are generated using the [Tetracorder system](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/tetracorder-user-guide-version-44?_gl=1*1eoj33d*_ga*MTU3MTA3ODgxNS4xNjQ5MTg1MDgx*_ga_0YWDZEJ295*MTY4NjkyNTg0Mi40NC4xLjE2ODY5MjU4NzMuMC4wLjA.)([code](https://github.com/PSI-edu/spectroscopy-tetracorder)) and are based on [EMITL2ARFL](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2ARFL.001) reflectance values. The product also consists of an EMIT_L2B_MINUNCERT file, which provides band depth uncertainty estimates calculated using surface Reflectance Uncertainty values from the [EMITL2ARFL](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2ARFL.001) data product. The band depth uncertainties are presented as standard deviations, and the fit score for each mineral identification is also provided as the coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>) of the match between the continuum normalized library reference and the continuum normalized observed spectrum. Associated metadata indicates the name and reference information for each identified mineral, and additional information about aggregating minerals into different categories, and the code used for product generation is available in the [emit-sds-l2b repository]().\n",

    "If we make the assumption that the XRD analysis are accurate, and that band-depth scales linearly with abundance, we can approximate the mineral abundance at the surface.  It should be noted that both of these assumptions are fraught - XRD analyses break down for some very small grainsize particles, particularly the Iron Oxides (Goethite and Hematite), and band-depth is heavily influenced by particle grain size, and so the abundance-band depth relationship is not linear.  We will expand on these details a bit more later, but for now lets take a look at what happens if we hold both of these as true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to run through each mineral that has a non-nan value in the mineral_groupings dataframe, and add up the sum of each of those within the scene.  A little matrix multiplication is all we need to do that.  Notably, in the emit-sds/emit-sds-l2b, this functionality is already built into the group_aggregator.py script in an efficient manner...but because the calculation is simple we'll reproduce here for learning purposes."
