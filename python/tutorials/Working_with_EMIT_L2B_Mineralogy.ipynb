    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will open the [EMIT L2B Estimated Mineral Identification and Band Depth and Uncertainty (EMITL2BMIN)](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2BMIN.001) products, find a mineral of interest from the ten mineral types focused on by the EMIT mission, evaluate uncertainty, orthorectify the data, then create an output mask or vector file for the granule.\n",

    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMIT instrument is an imaging spectrometer that measures light in visible and infrared wavelengths. These measurements display unique spectral signatures that correspond to the composition on the Earth's surface. The EMIT mission focuses specifically on mapping the composition of minerals to better understand the effects of mineral dust throughout the Earth system and human populations now and in the future. More details about EMIT and its associated products can be found in the **README.md** and on the [EMIT website](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [EMITL2BMIN](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2BMIN.001) data product provides estimated mineral identification, band depths and uncertainty in a spatially raw, non-orthocorrected format. Two spectral groups, which correspond to different regions of the spectra, are identified independently and often co-occur are used to identify minerals. These estimates are generated using the [Tetracorder system](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/tetracorder-user-guide-version-44?_gl=1*1eoj33d*_ga*MTU3MTA3ODgxNS4xNjQ5MTg1MDgx*_ga_0YWDZEJ295*MTY4NjkyNTg0Mi40NC4xLjE2ODY5MjU4NzMuMC4wLjA.)([code](https://github.com/PSI-edu/spectroscopy-tetracorder)) and are based on [EMITL2ARFL](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2ARFL.001) reflectance values. The product also consists of an EMIT_L2B_MINUNCERT file, which provides band depth uncertainty estimates calculated using surface Reflectance Uncertainty values from the [EMITL2ARFL](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2ARFL.001) data product. The band depth uncertainties are presented as standard deviations, and the fit score for each mineral identification is also provided as the coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>) of the match between the continuum normalized library reference and the continuum normalized observed spectrum. Associated metadata indicates the name and reference information for each identified mineral, and additional information about aggregating minerals into different categories, and the code used for product generation is available in the [emit-sds-l2b repository]().\n",
